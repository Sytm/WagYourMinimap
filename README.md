# WagYourMinimap
I have become dis-satisfied with the quality of current minimap offerings. whether that's due to missing functionality, broken functionality or a general lack of performance, I find that they have become worse over time.

While the quality of this one (at first) won't be as good, I make this with the goal of having an open and easy to work with api.
